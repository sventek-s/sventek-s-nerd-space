# MQTT Lab with Polymorph using Docker

I and a good [friend](https://twitter.com/iamckn) and [mentor](https://www.ckn.io/) usually train a class on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and we usually have various practical labs.
This post will mainly assist on how to setup an MQTT lab on docker with [polymorph](https://github.com/shramos/polymorph).
With this lab you can go through the [polymorph case studies](https://github.com/shramos/polymorph#using-polymorph).

> No need of setting up the enviroment on your localhost.

**PS:** Only tested on Linux, use tmux for split windows feature.

## Docker images

You will require to pull to docker images; `eclipse-mosquitto` and `ubuntu`.

```sh
docker pull eclipse-mosquitto ubuntu
```

## Machines

The lab requires three diffrent hosts; `machineA` which will be the **MQTT Broker**, `machineB` which will be the **MQTT Client** and `machineC` which will have polymorph installed (for modifying MQTT network packets on the fly).

## machine-A

Below is the `mosquitto.conf` file that you will require to continue to the next step.

```md
persistence false
allow_anonymous true
connection_messages true
log_type all
listener 1883
```

On the location where the conf file is run the command below;

```sh
# starting MQTT
docker run -it -p 1883:1883 --name machineA -h machineA -v `pwd`/mosquitto.conf:/mosquitto/config/mosquitto.conf eclipse-mosquitto
```

In a different terminal run the command below;

```sh
# creating a subscriber topic named test
docker exec -it machineA mosquitto_sub -t test
```

## machine-B

Spin up an ubuntu container with the below commad;

```sh
# pure ubuntu container
docker run -it --name machineB -h machineB ubuntu /bin/bash
```

Install MQTT and some other basic tools inside `machineB` container.

```sh
# installing MQTT and some other basic tools
apt update && apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients net-tools iputils-ping netcat -y
```

Test if we can send a message to our `machineA` subscriber topic `test`

```sh
mosquitto_pub -t test -m hello -h [machineA-ip]
mosquitto_pub -t test -m "it works" -h [machineA-ip]
```

`machineA` should be receiving published messages: `hello` and `it works` from `machineB`.

## machine-C

Spin up an ubunter container in privileged mode.

```sh
#pure ubuntu container
docker run --privileged -it --name MachineC -h MachineC ubuntu /bin/bash
```

Install polymorph dependancies and other basic tools.

```sh
# requirements
apt update && apt install python3 build-essential libnetfilter-queue-dev tshark \
    tcpdump python3-pip git net-tools iputils-ping tmux vim netcat iptables -y
pip3 install git+https://github.com/kti/python-netfilterqueue
# install polymorph
pip3 install polymorph
```

From here I guess you are good to go.
