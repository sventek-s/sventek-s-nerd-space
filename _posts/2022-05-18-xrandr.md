# Using "xrandr" command line tool to mirror a display to an external monitor

## Problem statement

Found this issue when doing some training, where I had connected my laptop to two external monitors; a hp 27 inch monitor and a 55 inch sony tv.
Having the training material on the Sony TV, I had to keep looking at the tv when scrolling. So after some googling found a solution where I could
mirror my laptop main display to the sony tv and problem solved.

## Solution

First confirm what connected display are present; `xrandr | grep -w connected`

Next set the display so that the external monitor will mirror the current display; `xrandr --output [mirror-display] --same-as [main-display]`

It works!!
