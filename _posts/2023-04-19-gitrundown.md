# Git-rundown

## Background

Happy new year!! So I am the kind of person facing problems then later on find ways to solve and document them. Due to lack of time I couldn't solve it as quick as possible but with OpenAi the coding was quick.

So started doing vuln research last year! Where I have private repo's of several CVE. Managing them is hard but trying to see if they are updated is one thing I wanted to do.

Credits to [Victoria Drake](https://victoria.dev/) the name and idea is her's from her [version](https://github.com/victoriadrake/git-rundown)

Read the [script](https://github.com/iAmG-r00t/whackyscripts/blob/main/git-rundown/gitrundown.sh) you will see what it does. It is whacky but gets the job done from my end.
